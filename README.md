# Dijkstra's Algorithm with Budget Constraints

This project demonstrates an implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm that calculates the shortest path between nodes in a graph while considering both distance and cost (budget constraints). The algorithm is particularly useful for applications like travel planning, where both distance and expense need to be optimized.

## Features
- **Graph Representation**: Nodes represent locations, and edges represent connections between them with associated distances and costs.
- **Budget Constraints**: The algorithm finds the shortest path while ensuring that the total travel cost does not exceed the given budget.
- **Visualization**: The solution includes a graphical representation of the graph, highlighting the shortest path and showing the distance and cost for each edge.

## Prerequisites
- Required Python libraries:
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `heapq`

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
```

## Usage
To run the code, simply execute the Python file:
```bash
python dijkstra_with_budget.py
```

### Example
Given a graph with the following nodes and edges:
- A -> B: Distance = 2, Cost = 5
- B -> D: Distance = 7, Cost = 15
- D -> E: Distance = 5, Cost = 8

The algorithm will calculate the shortest path from A to E under a specific budget.

## Visualization
The algorithm generates a visualization of the graph and highlights the shortest path based on the constraints. Each edge is labeled with its distance and cost.
